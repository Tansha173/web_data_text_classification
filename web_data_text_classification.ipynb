digital assets in 2022 Capital influx and supervision are all the focus Investors and industry insiders say regulation will play an important role in the direction of digital assets as many digital exchanges continue to operate in gray areas in many parts of Asia As digital assets grow in popularity among investors new types of blockchainbased securities and exchanges have emerged prompting regulators to act But rolling out the framework will take time leaving companies and investors in a regulatory bind A lot of regulators take an eitheror approach Either I dont want to do this I dont want to watch this or I think I can come up with convincing rules I think regulators should want to regulate and that takes a group that wants to come up with and Companies that follow these rules will cooperate Henry Chong founder of Hong Kongbased digital exchange Fusang told AsianInvestor Hong Kong and Singapore arguably the leading jurisdictions for digital assets in the region have been rolling out consultation papers and regulatory frameworks to regulate digital transactions In May Hong Kongs Financial Services and Treasury Bureau FSTB said it would require virtual asset exchanges to obtain a license from the Securities and Futures Commission SFC Currently virtual exchanges operate under an optin regime and are licensed under the same regulations as traditional trading and securities firms In Singapore which bills itself as an innovation hub fintech companies are setting up shop in the country where fintech funding has tripled to 3 billion in 2021 Crypto exchange Cryptocom moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore this year where other global cryptocurrency firms such as Coinbase Binance and Gemini have set up operations That said the Monetary Authority of Singapore MAS is still screening 400 license applications from digital token players Only a handful have been approved and about 70 are currently operating on temporary exempt licenses It remains to be seen how long these fintech companies are willing to wait for regulatory approval Binance Singapore announced on Monday December 13 that it will withdraw from the country breaking rumors that it will set up a global headquarters in Singapore In response to Binance Singapores departure a MAS spokesperson said Applicants may withdraw their applications as they deem fit in which case those operating under the exempt conditions will be required to cease providing regulated payment services Binance Asia Services has provided MAS with a plan for an orderly cessation of its regulated payment services MAS approach to regulation under the Payment Services Act is designed to foster innovation while ensuring appropriate controls are in place to address key risks such as money laundering and terrorist financing the spokesman said investor interest More than a decade after Bitcoin was founded its clear that the digital asset is here to stay While conservative asset owners continue to shy away from cryptocurrencies they have begun investing in the underlying technology and other blockchainenabled securities Cryptocurrency is a digital asset said Ankit Khandelwal chief investment officer at multifamily office Maitri Asset Management We are more interested in the underlying technology in these cryptocurrencies mainly blockchain technology which can have huge potential uses in various industries This technology makes a lot of sense and could have many use cases as well as the world of new developments in virtual spaces and metaverses he said Despite expressed interest Maitris family office clients have reservations about the digital asset space with most still in the learning and evaluation phase Very few clients are really investing in this space because its an evolving field in itself Theres a lot thats unknown here he said But one of the things weve heard from most investor feedback is that this technology shows a lot of promise Some of these uses include REITs funds or even just contracts legal contracts smart contracts which can be used in There are various use cases in different industries and in supply chain logistics Regulatory plus or minus Regardless of which direction regulation is headed experts agree that regulation is on the rise  and that will only give investors more confidence in digital assets and the underlying technology There are several digital asset classes that will increasingly come under the watchful eye of regulators including tethered stablecoins including private native cryptocurrencies said Benjamin Quinlan chairman of the Hong Kong Fintech Association All of this means that the regulatory arbitrage window is now closing fast or even disappearing people are going to need to play more of the regulated game That said its a plus and a minus for the industry But overall In general the tilt towards legality means that in order to achieve real institutional adoption the product set around the digital asset space needs to be inherently safer he said One benefit of increased regulation he added is that fintech companies are starting to realize that if they want to operate as a licensed financial institution theyre starting to understand that you cant just keep making products like crazy to create securitylike tools On the other hand a lot of brokers understand that business is being lost from them that their client base wants to trade digital assetsand now brokerages are even saying to us do we need to launch our own exchange to remain relevant is a very commoditized

trading platform FTX will the cryptocurrency be in trouble 20221216 If Bitcoin Bitcoin is a boxer it must be the kind of tough fighter who refuses to give up forever But in the past few weeks it has taken a beating with the collapse of digital asset industry giant FTX and the arrest of its founder Sam BankmanFried in the Caribbean Bitcoin is used to blows of all kinds but after its most battered year to date the antiestablishment warrior is now being pushed to the brink If Bitcoin were a boxer it would be lying in the ring by now staring at gold stars It fell but has it lost The Rise of Bitcoin Bitcoin has a doganddog story like the American movie Rocky In 2009 it was still equivalent to an Internet forum in the no matter what zone Bitcoins prospects were insignificant at that time and its value was only a few pennies But over the years its crowd of promoters has grown helping Bitcoin to develop against the mainstream Bitcoins value rose to tens of thousands of dollars and it began to gain recognition and popularity in some places It began to be accepted by some exclusive websites or trendy coffee shops Gradually against everyones expectations Bitcoin began to be sought after  like a champion boxer Thousands of imitators like Ethereum Dogecoin and Litecoin started appearing before Bitcoin peaked in 2021 with a surge in fame and value People started pouring money into it and other cryptocurrencies with a virtual coin worth nearly 70000 57200 Mainstream groups have also begun to turn to invest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency projects watershed Then in November of that year Bitcoin started to drop and has been going lower ever since Ongoing price drops and scandals have brought it to multiyear lows in terms of value credibility and appeal Its been a bad time for the cryptocurrency space and we may have worse days to come after the recent FTX scandal Its a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies said the Caribbean Blockchain Alliance Chairman Stefen Deleveaux said FTXs crash last month was the biggest shakeout in the crypto space in years It is the second largest trading platform in the world  the entry point for millions of people into the cryptocurrency space It was once regarded as one of the most trusted platforms but collapsed into bankruptcy just days after it was revealed that it was financially unstable FTX founder Sam BankmanFried is currently in custody accused by the US of building a house of cards based on fraud while telling investors its one of the safest structures in crypto  BankmanFried told the BBC that he wishes he hadnt killed cryptocurrencies because of it FTX certainly took a hit but 2022 itself has dealt blows to cryptocurrencies repeatedly Weve never seen anything like this in the cryptocurrency space before said Prof Carol Alexander from the University of Sussex Business School She predicted last year that cryptocurrencies would crash in 2022 but admitted she was taken aback by how often these events occurred wave after wave The first major blow came in May when two popular digital currencies collapsed costing Bitcoin and the entire crypto ecosystem 400 billion in value Do Kwon who created the Terra currency is now wanted by South Korean authorities allegedly hiding in Serbia A series of other scandals large and small have shaken trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem such as Kim Kardashian being fined 126 million for promoting an ultimately failed cryptocurrency In addition there is also the collapse of the nonfungible token Non Fungible Token market that was once booming In the past NFTs were sold for millions of dollars but now they are difficult to sell Confidence has also been hit by a spate of hacks against cryptocurrency companies the largest of which stole 600 million from operator Ronin Network As Bitcoin and all other virtual currencies shrink in value big virtual currency firms like Celsius Three Arrows Capital and BlockFi go bust costing investors big and small police Also investigating what happened The value of a single bitcoin often seen as a barometer of the entire virtual currency ecosystem is now hovering at less than 18000  a 70 drop from its November 2021 peak Can cryptocurrencies make a comeback The fall of trading platforms such as FTX has left a huge hole in the industry which has raised other concerns More than 14 billion was withdrawn from the Binance exchange on Tuesday This appears to be due to negative media coverage of cryptocurrencies Changpeng Zhao the companys founder urged calm on Twitter saying it was business as usual However Andy Renshaw senior vice president of product management at Feedzai said that cryptocurrencies will need to rely on a strong and diverse crowdfunding platform to survive this ongoing battle Without a trusted place to trade safely cryptocurrencies are unlikely to return to the status of champion boxers let alone grab gold beltsat least some basic skills still need to be corrected in training camp Digital currency is of course only a part of the encryption ecosystem but most peoples estimates are not optimistic about its value rising in the short term As a speculative asset cryptocurrencies appear to have a bleak future according to Prof Omid Malekan of Columbia Business School Prices have fallen and many of the largest providers of investmentrelated services have gone bust But he said that cryptocurrency is still first and foremost a technology to which he said Its in good shape better than ever in some ways The adoption of bitcoin and socalled stablecoins in developing countries without reliable financial infrastructure shows how the technology is improving peoples lives Professor Malekan said DeLorevo also believes that the cryptocurrencys ups and downs overshadow its overall progress He noted that cryptocurrencies are being used to help charities access funds in places where normal currency cannot be obtained due to war and economic depression He also said that the recent scandal is an opportunity to drive the scammers away in the crypto space Crypto is basically a very short summary of the future of the digital global economy said Professor Alexander She pointed out that the metaverse environment built with encryption technology has been regarded by some people as the form of future work and life View Details What are cryptocurrency prices today
